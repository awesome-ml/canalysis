Canalysis (Crime Analysis)
--------------------------
Canalysis is a machine learning, crime analysis framework written in C++11 and built for scalability of pattern recognition, prediction of crime trends and possible, future locations of criminal activity.

How Canalysis works
-------------------
Every year, hundreds of thousands of crimes are committed all throughout the world. With this, analyzing crimes and their variations has been pretty difficult, whereas you cannot predict the future. With the new uprising in Machine/Deep learning, we now enter a new stage in which we can recognize and possibly even predict where crimes could occur to prevent them with the use of large datasets. Canalysis does just that. With using only a CSV file that contains criminal data in your area, Canalysis can predict upon possible, future locations for which crimes could occur. This is done with the use of what is called a FeedForward Neural Network. Input data is fed to the neural network from via the CSV file. The network utilizes only three parameters within the file, the crime types, the crime latitudes and the crime longitudes. It then searches for patterns within the location data. Once it has done this, it'll generate probable predicted locations as to were specific crimes will occur (Note, these locations are in no way highly accurate, they merely are generated to form an idea as to where the majority of crimes are occurring). Once it has generated all the locations, the server will then form variances out of the predicted locations based on the closeness of the locations to each other. The variances with the higher crime rates inside a 5 mile radius are marked with high criminal activity and vice versa. However, while we cannot predict exactly where future criminal activity will take place, Canalysis can offer law enforcement a better way to analyze areas where crimes are most occurring, and make probable predictions as to where possible future crimes may take place based on previous, criminally active locations. This not only allows officers to be dispatched and arrive at the scene of the crime earlier, but to assess the crime scene itself in a much better perspective.
