Canalysis is still in an alpha development stage. It is being worked on regularly and will be in beta in mid-February. If you would like to contribute, please read the contribution file first.

Canalysis (Crime Analysis) Alpha
--------------------------------
Canalysis is a machine learning, crime analysis framework written in C++11 and built for scalability of pattern recognition, prediction of crime trends and possible, future locations of criminal activity.

How Canalysis works
-------------------
Every year, hundreds of thousands of crimes are committed all throughout the world. With this, analyzing crimes and their variations has been pretty difficult, whereas you cannot predict the future. With the new uprising in Machine/Deep learning, we now enter a new stage in which we can recognize and possibly even predict where crimes could occur to prevent them with the use of large datasets. Canalysis does just that. With using only a CSV file that contains criminal data in your area, Canalysis can predict upon possible, future locations for which crimes could occur. This is done with the use of what is called a FeedForward Neural Network. Input data is fed to the neural network from via the CSV file. The network utilizes only three parameters within the file, the crime types, the crime latitudes and the crime longitudes. The network then creates a model of only the locations. It then searches for what we are calling variances, which are areas where criminal activity is most occurring. The network compares all the variances to each other and keeps only the ones where crimes are most occurring (In this case, we have a const max variance variable of 25). This then allows the network to make an accurate prediction as to were future crimes may take place based on the distances with recorded variances proximities, and also plot the specific crime types that are most occurring as well. Now, while we cannot predict exactly where future criminal activity will take place, Canalysis can offer law enforcement a better way to analyze areas where crimes are most occurring, and make probable predictions as to where possible, future crimes may take place. This not only allows officers to be dispatched and arrive at the scene of the crime earlier, but to assess the crime scene itself in a much better perspective.
